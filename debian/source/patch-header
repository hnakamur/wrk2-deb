Subject: Collected Debian patches for wrk
Author: Robert Edmonds <edmonds@debian.org>

The wrk package is maintained in Git rather than maintaining
patches as separate files, and separating the patches doesn't seem to
be worth the effort.  They are therefore all included in this single
Debian patch.

For full commit history and separated commits, see the packaging Git
repository.
